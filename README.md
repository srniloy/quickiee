# Quickee 🍔 – Restaurant Website (Frontend-Only)

**Quickee** is a simple, clean frontend web application for a restaurant, built using **React**. It was developed as a learning project to practice foundational concepts of modern frontend development.

This project focuses on layout design, component structuring, props/state usage, and responsive styling all essential skills in React development.



## 🛠️ What is Quickee?

Quickee is a static React-based UI for a restaurant site. While it currently has **no backend functionality**, it demonstrates:

- 📋 Structured and styled **menu listing**
- 🎨 Reusable **components** for layout and sections
- 🧭 Functional **navigation bar**
- 📱 **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop screens

This project is a work-in-progress and can serve as the foundation for future full-stack development.

- Understand the structure of a React project
